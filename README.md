# SORTING-animation
File Name: `bubble.py`

Description:
------------------

The `bubble.py` script is a Python program that provides a visual representation of the Bubble Sort algorithm using the Pygame library. Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

**Key Features:**
1. **Visualization:** The script creates a graphical representation of the sorting process, where each element to be sorted is represented by a vertical bar, and the sorting operation is animated on the screen.

2. **Random Data Generation:** A list of random bar heights is generated to represent the elements needing sorting. These bars are displayed on the Pygame window.

3. **Real-time Animation:** The bars move and swap positions in real time to demonstrate how the Bubble Sort algorithm works. The bars being compared are highlighted in red for clarity.

4. **Time Gap:** A 0.02-second time gap has been introduced between each step of the sorting algorithm, allowing the viewer to follow the sorting process at a slower pace.

5. **User Interaction:** The script can be exited by closing the Pygame window, giving the user control over when to stop the visualization.

**How to Use:**
- Ensure you have Pygame installed (`pip install pygame`).
- Run the script, and a Pygame window displays the bars and the sorting animation.
- The bars will start sorting using the Bubble Sort algorithm, with a 0.02-second delay between each step.
- To exit the program, simply close the Pygame window.

This script serves as both a practical example of the Bubble Sort algorithm and an educational tool to understand how sorting algorithms operate visually. It can be customized and extended for educational purposes or as a foundation for more complex sorting algorithm visualizations.
